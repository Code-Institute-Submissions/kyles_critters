The dropdown menu for the 'Critters' nav link has been removed as the product options became to cluttered. Simple filter buttons have been added to the product page in order to keep the site clean.

The breadcrumb navigation has been changed for simple buttons to filter the products. 

The sorting box has been removed as the number of planned products sold at the pet store is currently 12. As the store adds more products a sorting box can be reconsidered.
